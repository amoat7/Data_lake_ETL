# Project 4: Data Lakes with Spark
---

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

In this project, I built a an ETL pipeline for the data lake, which is hosted on s3. The pipelien loads data from s3, processes the data into analytics tables using spark and loads the analytics tables as parquet files back into s3. 


## Project Datasets

The project uses two datasets that reside on s3. 
1. The song dataset ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data``` is a subset of data from the million song dataset. Each file is in JSON format and containsmeta data about a song and the artist of that song. 

2. The log dataset ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data ``` consists of log files generated by an event simulator based on the songs above. 


## Running the script

1. etl.py runs the entire ETL workflow. It creates the spark session, reads data from s3, transforms it with spark and loads the tables as parquet files back into spark.
